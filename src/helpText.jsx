      This field is optional. If left blank, edX will automatically
      create a URL slug based on the course title.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you find that a given URL slug is already in use, we recommend adding your
      school or institution name to the slug to ensure uniqueness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This URL slug can be changed, and learners who visit an older
      URL will be redirected to the current URL.
    </p>
    <p><b>What is a URL slug?</b></p>
    <p>
      In the following example URLs:
    </p>
    {isSubdirectoryFlagEnabled === 'false' && (
      <p>{oldUrlSlugExample}</p>
    )}
    {isSubdirectoryFlagEnabled === 'true' && (
      <p>
        {oldUrlSlugExample} <br /> {subdirectoryUrlSlugExample}
      </p>
    )}
    <span>
      Using URL slugs that are short and easily understandable helps learners find and
      remember course pages, and also drives higher rankings in search engine results.
